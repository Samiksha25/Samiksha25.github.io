									Some interesting facts about me : I love to code, design and paint.<br><br>

									The world of technology had fascinated me since childhood and hence I pursued my
									bachelor's degree in Computer Science from
										<a href="https://www.cumminscollege.org/">Cummins College</a>  in Pune, India.
									After my bachelor's degree, I started working as a developer at
										<a href="https://www.sap.com/india/index.html"> SAP Labs India.</a>
									The best part about my job was that I got to work very closely with customers,
									understanding their business problems and finding technical solutions. This work
									experience has helped me develop a strong knowledge of technical business processes
									and issue resolutions.
										<br><br>

									In 2019, India was facing massive floods and millions of people were distressed.
									I wanted to help people and hence I formed a team of three equally motivated people.
									I developed a minimal viable product based on Artificial Intelligence technology,
									to accelerate the process of disaster response.
									I headed customer engagements and defined the product vision and strategy.
									This project was able to impact more than 10,000+ lives and is hence the highlight
									of my career so far. During this journey, I witnessed the power of data and AI
									technology and hence decided to pursue my master's in Management Information Systems
									to gain in-depth knowledge in Data Mining, Business Intelligence and
									Data Visualization. <br><br>

									During my master's here, I have successfully finished courses such as Enterprise
									Data Management, Data Mining & Business Intelligence, Statistics and
									Business Communications.

									In my free time, I am an artist, and I love to paint, sketch and do photography.
									Overall, I have a very technical background and a creative mindset. I strive to use
									my skills to solve business and social problems. <br><br>
